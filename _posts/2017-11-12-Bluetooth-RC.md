### Bluetooth Remote Controlled Car

My team consisted of:
* Melissa Do
* Emma Rivera
* Cindy Quach

We used the Arduino IDE to build a motorized car that was controlled by personal Android application. 

From this project, we learned how to program using the Arduino IDE, build simple circuits, the difference between digital and analog signals, and how to solder wires onto our LED lights.

Other than Melissa, the rest of the team had never been to a Hackathon before nor had prior experience with working with hardware. So we approached this opportunity with the goal of learning how to step out of our comfort zones and into the engineering world. Considering our experience with hardware, we achieved something great by being awarded the Best Hardware Hack!
