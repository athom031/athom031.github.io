#### Project Overview

**Arya the ChatBot**

* A sleek AI interface designed to provide users with a personalized conversational experience
* Based on the way a user interacts with "her", Arya's personality can dynamically evolve
* Thus the learned personality level will adjust its engagement and responses to user prompts

**Nearest Neighbor Classifier**

* A powerful machine learning model designed to classify instances based on their feature sets
* This innovative approach leverages the nearest neighbor classifier and the one-out algorithm to create accurate and efficient class models
* A model is learned based off of some starting N instances with an assigned class and a set of M features

**8-Puzzle Problem Solver**

* Offers a search algorithm to efficiently solve the famous [8-Puzzle Problem](https://blog.goodaudience.com/solving-8-puzzle-using-a-algorithm-7b509c331288)
* This is achieved by mapping out potential paths from initial state and determining the shortest sequence of steps to achieve the goal state

#### Technical Achievements
* Gained real project experience covering 3 areas of AI/ML:
1. *Logic Systems*: The ability to take previous data and rules to then manipulate them and create new facts.
2. *Machine Learning*: System that takes previous data to "learn" schema and then apply it to new data.
3. *Search*: Process of traversing from a start state to a goal state through a set of intermediate states.

#### Impact
* Class was an opportunity to delve into some of the most cutting-edge technologies within software engineering
* Arya the chat bot is a stepping stone to the technology that allowed for ChatGPT and other natural language models
