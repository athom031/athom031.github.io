My team consisted of:
* Melissa Do
* Emma Rivera
* Cindy Quach

We used the Arduino IDE to build a motorized car that was controlled by a personal Android application.

From this project, we learned how to program through the Arduino IDE, build simple circuits, the difference between digital and analog signals, and how to solder wires onto our LED lights.

This was my first hackathon as it was for Emma and Cindy. Furthermore, none of us had any prior experience working with hardware. Therefore, we took up this opportunity to step out of our comfort zone and learn as much as possible. Considering our technical expertise at this time, it was a great accomplishment to be awarded **Best Hardware Hack**!
