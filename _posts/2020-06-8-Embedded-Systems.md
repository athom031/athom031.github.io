### Final Project: LCD Racer

#### LCD racing game. <br/>

Help player Smee (>) avoid the obstacles (#). The obstacles increase over time and give an even larger challenge to Smee.
<br/>
Try and beat your high score!

### Task Scheduler

<i>Highlight: </i> Legen... wait for it <br/>

Concurrent syncSM that scrolls through text to display the string "Legen ... wait for it ... DARY!!", which is too big to fit on the LCD screen.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/onJCacxnShQ) <br/>

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

<i>Highlight: </i> Music Player <br/>

A SM that uses PWM functionality to scale through the C scale and play the Kal Ho Naa Ho theme song (Bollywood song).

### Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

<i>Highlight: </i> Light Sensor <br/>

This is a system connected to a photo resistor. Based on the light, output the level on a bank of eight LEDs as a representation of the light level.

<div id="lab6"></div>

### synchSMs

<i>Highlight: </i> Catch the Light <br/>

A simple light game where an array of LEDs cycles up and down. The task of the player is to try and press the button when the middle light is on. Each time the player succeeds, score is incremented on an LED screen. 

[Demo](https://youtu.be/7MUxzIRRO7U) <br/>

### ATMega1284 Microcontroller Intro

<i>Highlight: </i> Fuel Level <br/>

Input is connected to fuel tank gas level (numeric), so that we can output LED sequence that signifies what fuel level is. Additional light sequence for when levels dip low as a warning.

[Demo](https://youtu.be/xjrFZ647MQU) <br/>
[Source](https://github.com/athom031/EmbeddedSystems/blob/master/projects/source/Lab5/athom031_lab5_part1.c)

<div id="lab4"></div>

### State Machines

<i>Highlight: </i> Digital Combination Deadbolt <br/>

A digital combination deadbolt that takes input and authorizes entrance to the garage doorway. Entering the combination again will lock the doorway.

<div id="lab3"></div>

### Bit Manipulation
<i>Highlight: </i> Airbag Light <br/>

The input includes the weight sensor in the driver's seat. Based on this, signify whether or not the airbag is abled.

[Source](https://github.com/athom031/EmbeddedSystems/blob/master/projects/source/Lab3/athom031_lab3_part5.c)

<div id="lab2"></div>

### AVR Toolchain Intro 
<i>Highlight: </i> Weight Sensor <br/>

Weight sensor for amusement park ride that insures the weight is balanced across three seats and meets certain restrictions.
