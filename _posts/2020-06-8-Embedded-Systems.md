### Lab 11: Task Scheduler

#### Part 1 
Code the keypad to be a SM task and implements a task scheduler to output the ASCII code for the character being pressed.
#### Part 2
Display the message "CS120 is Legend... wait for it DARY!". <br/>
The string does not fit on the display all at once, so the display scrolls through the text.
#### Part 3 
Implement a task scheduler to print the character last pressed.
#### Part 4
Have a string displayed that takes up the display and implement a task scheduler to iterate through the display index and output user characters over the string.

### Lab 10: Concurrent synchSMs

#### Part 1 
A concurrent SM that runs a SM for threeLDs to alternate each second and another SM blink a fourth light.
#### Part 2
An edited concurrent SM from the one above that "appears" to opperate on different periods.
#### Part 3 
An edited concurrent SM from the one above that now includes a speaker to be toggled every 2 ms.
#### Part 4
Includes user input to change what frequency the speaker outputs audio.

### Lab 9: PWM (Music Player)

#### Part 1 
With the PWM functionality, a designed system uses three buttons to play three different tones on a speaker.
#### Part 2
A SM that uses PWM functionality to scale through the C scale.
#### Part 3 
A SM that uses PWM functionality to play Kal Ho Na Ho theme.

### Lab 8: ADC

#### Part 1 
A system that reads the 10-bit ADC result from a potentiometer and displays it on a LED array.
#### Part 2
A system that replaces the potentiometer with a photoresistor and displays it on a LED array.
#### Part 3 
A system that uses max and min results from previous lab to then only illuminate LED when enough light is detected on the photo resistor.
#### Part 4
A system, using a bank of eight LEDs, where the number of LEDs illuminated is a representation of how much light is detected.

### Lab 7: LCD Screen

#### Part 1 
Output a number that can be incremented or decremented with a button press.
#### Part 2
Cycling LED array cycle game, where score is incrememnted when the button is pressed and the middle light is illuminated.

<div id="lab6"></div>

### Lab 6: synchSMs

#### Part 1
A syncSM that blinks three LEDs in increasing and decreasing order, 1 second each.
#### Part 2
A simple light game that requires pressing a button when the middle light is illuminated. Pressing the light again restarts the game.
#### Part 3
LEDs represents bit # representation. Pressing one button increases the #, presssing another decreases the #.

### Lab 5: ATMega1284 Microcontroller Intro

#### Part 1
Based on the fuel tank given as input, have the lights warn what the fuel level is.
#### Part 2
Increment or decrement output with button presses.
#### Part 3
A festive light display.

<div id="lab4"></div>

### Lab 4: State Machines

#### Part 1
Implemented on button and off button for an LED.
#### Part 2
Increment or decrement output based on button press.
#### Part 3
Digital combination deadbolt lock system for garage doorway.
#### Part 4
Extended dedadbolt where entering the lock key again will then lock the unlocked door.
#### Part 5
Further extended deadbolt that requires a 4-button sequence rather than 2-button sequence. This SM is instead represented with an array rather than a state for each button press.

<div id="lab3"></div>

### Lab 3: Bit Manipulation

#### Part 1
Output the number of the number of 1's on two input ports.
#### Part 2
Output fuel level based on fuel tank count.
#### Part 3
Extend fuel level output to flash light if seatbelt is not fastened and driver is seated.
#### Part 4
Take the upper nibble of PINA and map it to the lower nibble of PORTB and vice versa.
#### Part 5
Based on driver seat weight, siginfy whether or not the airbag is abled.

### Lab 2: AVR Toolchain Intro


#### Part 1
Illuminate an LED if the garage door is open at night.
#### Part 2
Output the number of available parking spaces in a parking garage.
#### Part 3
Extended available parking for a warning if parking lot is full.
#### Part 4
Weight sensor for amusement park ride with three seats that insures the weight is balanced.
