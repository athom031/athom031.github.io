title: "Audio Signal Processing: Knowles Internship"
---

#### Projects inspired by 2019 Summer Internship with [Knowles Intelligent Audio](https://www.knowles.com/)
---

#### Project Overview

Split Script
* Developed a split script similar to technology used in Knowles Data Collection
* Script is used in automation of training and evaluating voice command technology
* Takes single audio file and config information to then output each named utterance from test user recording
* Determines utterances based on silence measurements between each phrase

Audio Cutter
* Designed a Desktop Widget to allow users to cut out unwanted ranges of audio files
* Allows for easier audio cutting than hand trimming

Silence Trimmer and Audio Normalizer 
* Automates audio processing for songs within desired directory
* Takes collection of audio files to trim out silence and normalize decibel levels
by taking audio files and trimming out silence before start and end of song

#### Technical Achievements 
* Developed proficiency in utilizing audio processing APIs, specifically Audio Segment and PyDub, enabling efficient manipulation and analysis of audio data
* Learned how to develop desktop applications with a user-friendly GUI 
* Optimized company audio parsing scripts, addressing inefficiencies and removing bottlenecks, resulting in a signficant 1.3x speedup 

#### Impact 
* Projects serve as a comprehensive summary of experience gained during first technical internship
* Demonstrated a proactive approach to explore how learning could be combined with outside passions
* Further highlighted drive to continue developing software that aligns with personal interests and expanding skill sets
* Capitalized on opportunity to understand inner workings of company tooling and seeking opportunities for improvement and optimization
