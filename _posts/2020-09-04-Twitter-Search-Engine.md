* Developed a Twitter search engine with a user-friendly front-end allowing searches for relevant tweets from the Fall of 2020, displaying matched results with embedded tweets in a clean format
* Implemented a highly efficient search mechanism utilizing a Lucene index to quickly and accurately return the most relevant tweet among millions of previously crawled tweet data

#### Technical Achievements

* Collaborated in a team of two to build a robust Twitter crawler and employed information retrieval theory to crawl and index a vast dataset of 9 million tweets
* Overcame backend and frontend network collision challenges by leveraging specialized Spring framework, successfully resolving REST service CORS issues for seamless operation

#### Impact

* Strengthened understanding of Information Retrieval Theory through practical application in a real-world project, providing valuable insights into search engine development
* Acquired hands-on experience in handling large-scale data processing and indexing, contributing to enhanced skills in data retrieval and efficient query processing
* Gained valuable teamwork and problem-solving skills while working collaboratively on a complex project, preparing for future challenges in software development endeavors
* Demonstrated exceptional drive and determination by independently completing the Twitter search engine beyond the classroom, showcasing self-motivation and a passion for web development
