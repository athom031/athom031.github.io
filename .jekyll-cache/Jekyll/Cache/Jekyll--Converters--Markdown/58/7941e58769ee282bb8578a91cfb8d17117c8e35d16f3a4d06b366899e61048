I"_<p>I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside. I studied for four years to get my B.S. in Computer Science. I was an honors student who worked hard to maintain a 3.77 GPA while taking a myriad of engineering courses, having lead roles in South Asian dance and acapella teams on campus, and orchestrating my own podcast series exploring just how American Immigrants develop their identities.</p>

<p>This last summer, I worked as an intern at Knowles Intelligent Audio. I got to gain professional experience while discovering an entirely new field, the audio space. And that’s something I love to do. Being a developer was not something that just came to me but what I held onto was my passion for learning. And that passion for learning is what pushed me to get experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and embedded systems.</p>

<p>Ultimately my journey has brought out the skill I have for working with people to solve problems. During quarantine and my prospective job searching, I haven’t lost that love for learning. Ive been teaching myself javascript and have been building a full stack web application. And that is what has put me on the path of becoming a full-stack software developer.</p>
