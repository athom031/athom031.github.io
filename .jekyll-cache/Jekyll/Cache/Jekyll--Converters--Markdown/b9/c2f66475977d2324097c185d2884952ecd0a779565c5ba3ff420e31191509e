<p><em>Search</em>: The process of traversing from a start state to a goal state through a set of intermediate states. <br />
<em>Machine Learning</em>: An application that provides a system with the ability to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from previous data. <br />
<em>Logic Systems</em>: The ability to take previous data and rules and then manipulate them to create new facts.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>A python implementation of a search solution to the 8 puzzle <a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/solving-8-puzzle-using-a-algorithm-7b509c331288">problem</a>. <br /></p>

<p>Three methods are used to show the merit of A* search and within that, the importance of a good heuristic.<br />
Uniform Cost Search only depends on the movement cost to determine the next move.<br />
A* Search uses the movement cost to determine the next move but adding to that includes a heuristic function to determine the best next step. The A* search used, depends on two different heuristics.<br />
<em>Misplaced Tile</em> checks how many tiles are where they shouldn‚Äôt be. <br />
<em>Manhattan Distance</em> checks how far each tile is from where it should be. <br /></p>

<p>We can see building upon the movement cost to predict the next best step, reduces the runtime and space complexity exponentially. The heuristic chosen also matters. I was surprised that the misplaced tile performed better for this example than the Manhattan distance because from theory, the Manhattan distance uses more information about the actual state. But they are very similar and might vary for other examples.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>

<p>Given a feature set with N classified instances and M features, we want to find the feature subset that will best represent the dataset for future unclassified instances. This uses the Nearest Neighbor Classifier and One Out algorithm to measure each potential feature subset.</p>
<h5 id="one-out-algorithm">One Out Algorithm:</h5>
<p>Take one data point out and build a Nearest Neighbor classifier from the current feature subset. Then use this classifier to guess the one out point. We do this for every point to determine the accuracy of our current feature subset.</p>
<h5 id="feature-selection">Feature Selection:</h5>
<p>We select features one of two ways, either we start with no features (forward selection) or all features (backward selection). Then we simply greedily narrow it down to the most accurate subset of features (remember we evaluate accuracy with the one out algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="warnings">Warnings</h3>

<p>Though foward selection and backward selection will result in similar accurate feature subset, these subsets will not always be the same. <br />
Forward selection will replicate the accuracy of backward selection with less features. <br />
This makes the features picked by Backwards Selection harder to pick. <br />
Backwards Selection also takes more time on larger datasets. <br />

<p>Arya is a chat bot that represents her learned personality (‚Äònegative‚Äô, ‚Äòneutral‚Äô, or ‚Äòpositive‚Äô) with a score and responds occordingly. <br /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/Files/ArtificialIntelligence/aryaSoccer.png" />
<br /></p>

<p>Each line, her personality ‚Äòscore‚Äô is at a positive, netural, and negative level accordingly. Though the user input changes, Arya ‚Äòfeels‚Äô like responding in a different way.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h3>

<p>This is a simple AI interface that responds to user entries based on the conversation and personality of the AI. If the user enters positive entries, the AI personality will slowly rise. But if the user starts sending negative messages, Arya‚Äôs personality will start to drop.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>AI is a complex field which is the reason for the Turing Test to exist. <br />
Because of that there are limitations on Arya.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arya‚Äôs vocabulary is off a database of words and this is character specific, therefore capitalization does change understanding</li>
  <li>Some phrases will simply not be understood because of the limits of the words understood by Arya.</li>
  <li>Because of this can crash and just not respond on some user input.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="user-input-examples">User Input Examples</h3>

<p>Some output stays the same no matter the personality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù will return standard time of clock <br /></li>
</ul>

<p>The other output will change based on how Arya feels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúI am good at <em>insert noun</em>‚Äù <br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Input will affect Arya‚Äôs personality beyond setting it manually:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúYou are a <em>insert adj</em>‚Äù</li>
</ul>
