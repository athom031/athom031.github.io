            Music in the American Indian Identity - A Podcast Series
        </h2>

        <p>
            <br />
            This podcast series, "The Chai Chai Talk", was my unique approach to the UCR Honors Capstone Project. It was an exploration outside of my engineering degree, delving into the intersection of music and identity within the Indian-American community. From conception to production, I managed this project, conducting interviews and creating a series of podcasts that shed light on how music plays a part in the cultural identity of American children of Indian parents. This project was not just an academic endeavor, but a personal journey that I am immensely proud of. It reflects my ability to manage and execute a project, and my passion for exploring diverse fields beyond my technical expertise.

            Abstract
        </h2>

        <p>
            Children born of Indian Immigrants in the U.S. often struggle to balance their two conflicting identities. In the name of fitting in, traditions and memories are forgotten to accommodate what is thought of as normal. Because of that, part of who they are is pushed to the side. This project seeks to find how Indian Americans use music to identify with their other half. My research is a series of interviews with members of UCRâ€™s Hindi-Film Dance team, UCR Afsana. These interviews were then edited and condensed into a series of podcasts where American children of Indian parents share their path on identifying with their South Asian culture. And how much of a part, music plays in it. In some cases, this project can even show how music serves as a vehicle to join their two halves. This project aims to evaluate a possible solution in alleviating the struggles of confused identities many children of immigrant families have to deal with.

        <p>
            In the first episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the podcast series itself, as an exploration of the relationship Indian Americans have with music and how it helps them cultivate their identity. American music has an independent culture associated with it. The music you are into, is a conversation starter in and of itself and not restricted to the national boundaries. But the culture associated with Indian music might be inherently alien to some. And therefore we also start with an introduction as to what Indian music tends to be for most Indian Americans. We are joined by Manny, a fourth year Biology student from Calexico, California. We hope to break the stereotypes that get pushed onto South Asian music and make clearer the diversity in such a large region.
