            Music in the American Indian Identity - A Podcast Series
        </h2>

        <p>
            <br />
            This podcast series, "The Chai Chai Talk", was my unique approach to the UCR Honors Capstone Project. It was an exploration outside of my engineering degree, delving into the intersection of music and identity within the Indian-American community. From conception to production, I managed this project, conducting interviews and creating a series of podcasts that shed light on how music plays a part in the cultural identity of American children of Indian parents. This project was not just an academic endeavor, but a personal journey that I am immensely proud of. It reflects my ability to manage and execute a project, and my passion for exploring diverse fields beyond my technical expertise.

            Abstract
        </h2>

        <p>
            Children born of Indian Immigrants in the U.S. often struggle to balance their two conflicting identities. In the name of fitting in, traditions and memories are forgotten to accommodate what is thought of as normal. Because of that, part of who they are is pushed to the side. This project seeks to find how Indian Americans use music to identify with their other half. My research is a series of interviews with members of UCR’s Hindi-Film Dance team, UCR Afsana. These interviews were then edited and condensed into a series of podcasts where American children of Indian parents share their path on identifying with their South Asian culture. And how much of a part, music plays in it. In some cases, this project can even show how music serves as a vehicle to join their two halves. This project aims to evaluate a possible solution in alleviating the struggles of confused identities many children of immigrant families have to deal with.

        <p>
            In the first episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the podcast series itself, as an exploration of the relationship Indian Americans have with music and how it helps them cultivate their identity. American music has an independent culture associated with it. The music you are into, is a conversation starter in and of itself and not restricted to the national boundaries. But the culture associated with Indian music might be inherently alien to some. And therefore we also start with an introduction as to what Indian music tends to be for most Indian Americans. We are joined by Manny, a fourth year Biology student from Calexico, California. We hope to break the stereotypes that get pushed onto South Asian music and make clearer the diversity in such a large region.

        <p>
            In the second episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the phenomenon of having a dual identity. Being an Indian American often makes it so that we grow up not feeling at home at home. “Immigrant Americans”, with the title alone, often regard themselves as different. But if the time ever came, to visit where their families came from, their ancestral home is an even bigger unknown. When we grow up in America, we never feel American but when we go to India, we are not treated like Indians. We are joined by Manasi, a third year business major from San Diego, California. She provides insight on what it was like to grow up as an Indian American in America. We hope to paint a clearer picture as to why at some point the question, “…So what are we?”, gets asked.

            In the third episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we continue our conversation with Manasi. As mentioned before, Manasi is a third year business major from San Diego, California. In the previous episode we admitted a lot of our understanding comes from Indian media (ie: Bollywood). Now we explore how the Bollywood media can never be a faithful representation of Indian culture. And yet it is what we were given and will be one of the few things we are able to carry over from our childhoods into our childrens’. This causes a conundrum when we consider that there is a desire for our children to have a relationship with their Indian heritage. Because the India we have to give to our kids is diluted.

            In the fourth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Sarena. Sarena is a fourth year business major who grew up in Chino Hills, California, a predominantly white area. In the last episode we brought up the question of how we will give our children a relationship with India without having a strong connection ourselves. In this episode we talk to Sarena who grew up in a household of Indian Americans rather than Indian immigrants. Together we discuss the effects of a non Indian upbringing and the later shift she explored in finding her identity on her own.

So far in this podcast, most of the Indian music brought up has been movie-music. Vishant introduces the audience to the underground music culture and how it is growing. As it grows it is starting to get integrated with the movie music itself. But we ask the question just how much it will change and challenge the movie music industry I grew up with.

        <h3>Joined by S.</h3>

        <p>
            In the sixth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by S. S is a third year Neuroscience student from Fremont, California. S and I attempt to deconstruct the over sexualization/objectification of women in Bollywood that exists despite the restrictive and conservative image of what woman “should” be in India. This Bollywood culture continues to exist by silently discounting the Indian-ness within their item girls. And a current new trend of putting forward non-Indian item girls to sexualize a different culture while maintaining the “cultured” image of an Indian woman. Additionally we will talk about not being the “right” kind of Indian due to our religion and colorism issues we have seen with Indian culture in our Indian upbringing. A controversial wide expanse of topics that serve as only the start to a much larger and needed conversation.

        <p>
            In the seventh episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Nihal. Nihal is a second year Business major from Fremont, California. So far in the podcast we have explored two main music trends in Bollywood. Popular independent music gets a new skin and is inserted into the next big movie. And the industry of item songs has continued to grow and become more prevalent. But there is a third trend that has taken over the music industry. Similar to movie remake culture in Hollywood, songs of the past are given a modern remake and become part of the movie soundtrack. With these three trends taking over movie albums, songs are rarely an original part of the movie that carries the narrative. And so the music evolution is taking Bollywood music away from the culture I grew up with. What impact will that have on the new viewers, and their children?
