          <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

          <p>Children born of Indian Immigrants in the U.S. often struggle to balance their two conflicting identities.
            In the name of fitting in, traditions and memories are forgotten to accommodate what is thought of as
            normal. Because of that, part of who they are is pushed to the side. This project seeks to find how Indian
            Americans use music to identify with their other half. My research is a series of interviews with members of
            UCR’s Hindi-Film Dance team, UCR Afsana. These interviews were then edited and condensed into a series of
            podcasts, where American children of Indian parents share their path to how music plays a part in
            identifying with their South Asian culture. In some cases, this project can even how how music even serves
            as a vehicle to join their two halves. This project aims to evaluate a possible solution in alleviating the
            struggles of confused identities many children of immigrant families have to deal with.

          <p>In the first episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the podcast series itself, as an exploration of
            the relationship Indian Americans have with music and how it helps them cultivate their identity. American
            music has an independent culture associated with it. the music you are into, is a conversation starter in
            and of itself and not restricted to the national boundaries. But the culture associated with Indian music
            might be inherently alien to some. And therefore we also start with an introduction as to what Indian music
            tends to be for most Indian Americans. We are joined by Manny Garcia, a fourth year Biology student from
            Calexico, California who gives an outside perspective. We hope to break the stereotypes that get pushed onto
            South Asian music and make clearer the diversity in such a large region.

          <p>In the second episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the phenomenon of having a dual identity. Being
            an Indian American often makes it so that we grow up not feeling at home at home. “Immigrant Americans”,
            with the title alone, often regard themselves as different. But if the time ever came to visit where their
            families came from, their ancestral home is an even bigger unknown. When we grow up in America, we never
            feel American but when we go to India, we are not treated like Indians. We are joined by Manasi Soni, a
            third year business major from San Diego, California. She provides insight on what it was like to grow up as
            an Indian American in America. We hope to paint a clearer picture as to why at some point the question, “…So
            what are we?”, gets asked.

          <p>In the third episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we continue our conversation with Manasi Soni. As mentioned
            before, Manasi is a third year business major from San Diego, California. In the previous episode we
            admitted a lot of our understanding comes from Indian media (ie: Bollywood). Now we explore how the
            Bollywood media can never be a faithful representation of Indian culture. And yet it is what we were given
            and will be one of the few things we are able to carry over from our childhoods into our childrens’. This
            causes a conundrum when we consider that there is a desire for our children to have a relationship with
            their Indian heritage. Because the India we have to give to our kids is diluted.

            business major who grew up in Chino Hills, California, a predominantly white area. In the last episode we
            brought up the question of how we will give our children a relationship with India without having a strong
            connection ourselves. In this episode we talk to Sarena who grew up in a household of Indian Americans
            rather than Indian immigrants. Together we discuss the effects of a non Indian upbringing and the later
            shift she explored in finding her identity on her own.

            Bio-Engineering student from Pleasonton, California. So far in this podcast, most of the Indian music
            brought up, has been movie-music. Vishant introduces the audience to the underground music culture and how
            it is growing. As it grows it is starting to get integrated with the movie music itself. But we ask the
            question just how much it will change and challenge the movie music industry I grew up with.

          <p>In the sixth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by S. S is a third year Neuroscience student from
            Fremont, California. We have a very difficult conversation that covers a wide expanse of topics and is
            definitely not without controversy. S and I attempt to deconstruct the over sexualization/objectification of
            women in Bollywood that exists despite the restrictive and conservative image of what woman “should” be in
            India. This Bollywood culture continues to exist by silently discounting the Indian-ness within their item
            girls. And a current new trend of putting forward non-Indian item girls to sexualize a different culture
            while maintaining the “cultured” image of an Indian woman. Additionally we will talk about not being the
            “right” kind of Indian due to our religion and colorism issues we have seen with Indian culture in our
            Indian upbringing. This is only the start of a conversation that should be continued on.

          <p>In the seventh episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Nihal Deopura. Nihal is a second year
            Business major from Fremont, California. So far in the podcast we have explored two main music trends in
            Bollywood. Popular independent music gets a new skin and inserted into the next big movie. Item songs have
            grown as an industry and are becoming more prevalent. But there is a third trend that has taken over the
            music industry. Similar to movie remake culture in Hollywood, songs of the past are given a modern remake
            and become part of the movie soundtrack. With these three trends taking over movie albums, songs are rarely
            an original part of the movie that carries the narrative. And so the music evolution is taking Bollywood
            music away from the culture I grew up with. What impact will that have on the new viewers, and their
            children?
