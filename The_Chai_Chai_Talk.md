### Music in the American Indian Identity - A Podcast Series
##### UCR Honors Capstone Project

Children born in of Indian Immigrants in the U.S. often struggle to balance their two conflicting identities. In the name of fitting in, traditions and memories are forgotten to accommodate what is thought of as normal. Because of that, part of who they are is pushed to the side. This project seeks to find how Indian Americans use music to identify with their other half. My research is a series of interviews with members of UCRâ€™s Hindi-Film 
Dance team, UCR Afsana. These interviews were then edited and condensed into a series of podcasts, where American children of Indian parents share their path to how music plays a part in identifying with their South Asian culture. In some cases, this project can show how music even serves as a vehicle to join their two halves. This project aims to evaluate a possible solution in alleviating the struggles of confused identities many children of immigrant families 
have to deal with.
