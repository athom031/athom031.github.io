I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside. I studied for four years to get my B.S. in Computer Science. I was an honors student who worked hard to maintain a 3.76 GPA while taking a myriad of engineering courses, having lead roles in South Asian dance and acapella teams on campus, and orchestrating my own podcast series exploring just how American Immigrants develop their identities. 

In my professional experience, I was able to work as an intern at Knowles Intelligent Audio and explore the audio space. A reoccurring theme is my drive for exploring new fields which comes from holding onto my passion for learning. And that passion for learning led me to explore artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and full stack development which are skills demonstrated in projects found on the home page. Ultimately my journey has brought out the skill I have for working with people to solve problems.
