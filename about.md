I am a Software Engineer with three years of proven experience at Meta Reality Labs (Facebook) as an Infrastructure Engineer. Graduating with Honors in Computer Science from the University of California, Riverside, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and have developed expertise in Software Development, Infrastructure Engineering, Full Stack Web Development, Data Analytics, and Android UI/UX.

My journey has led me to work on cutting-edge projects, such as developing a Full Stack web application for scalable Twitter search and creating firmware update automation tools for Portal devices. With a strong drive for continuous learning and a knack for collaborative problem-solving, I thrive in both personal and team-oriented projects.

I take pride in my dedication to Software Engineering, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities and challenges.
