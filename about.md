I am a Software Engineer working at Sigma Connectivity Inc. Currently on project with a FAANG company since the beginning of 2021, I have taken it upon myself to explore each new field I have come across. Starting in Android UX, specializing in Accessibility, and then diving into build tools has expanded my skillset considerably since coming out of university.

I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with an Honors Degree in Computer Science the summer of 2020. A recurring theme of my time in and out of college is my passion for learning. That passion has led me to explore artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and full stack development demonstrated in the projects and roles found on the home page.

Ultimately my journey has brought out the drive to keep learning each day and the skill I have for working with people to solve problems.
